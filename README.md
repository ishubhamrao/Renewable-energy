Renewable Energy Analysis with Python
This project aims to analyze historical data on renewable energy usage to identify trends, patterns, and adoption rates across different countries and regions. The analysis includes visualizations to understand the variations in renewable energy usage over time and across geographical locations. Additionally, the project compares the adoption and utilization of renewable energy sources across different countries, identifies leading countries in renewable energy production and consumption, and explores factors contributing to their success. Furthermore, it conducts a market analysis of the renewable energy sector, including market size, growth opportunities, and key players. The project also identifies emerging trends, technologies, and investment opportunities in the renewable energy market.
Getting Started
To run the analysis, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.
Place your dataset file in the data/ folder.
Execute the analysis.py script to perform the analysis.
View the generated visualizations in the visualizations/ folder.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains historical data on renewable energy usage, including information on countries, regions, years, and the percentage of renewables in primary energy consumption. The dataset file should be in CSV format and include the following headers:

Entity: Country or region name
Code: Country code
Year: Year of observation
Renewables (% equivalent primary energy): Percentage of renewables in primary energy consumption
Analysis
The analysis consists of three main parts:

Identifying Trends and Patterns: Analyzing historical data to identify trends and patterns in the adoption of renewable energy sources over time.
Visualizing Changes Across Countries and Regions: Visualizing the changes in renewable energy usage across different countries and regions to understand adoption rates and variations.
Country-wise Comparison: Comparing the adoption and utilization of renewable energy sources across different countries, identifying leading countries, and exploring factors contributing to their success.
Renewable Energy Market Analysis: Conducting a market analysis of the renewable energy sector, including market size, growth opportunities, and key players. Identifying emerging trends, technologies, and investment opportunities.
Conclusion
Through this analysis, we gain insights into the adoption and utilization of renewable energy sources globally, understand variations across different countries and regions, and identify key players and emerging trends in the renewable energy market.
